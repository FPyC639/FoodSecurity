# Food Insecurity

This Jupyter Notebook contains a exploratory analysis of food insecurity via this link:

I downloaded the zip and then used the spreadsheet in the zip to begin my analysis. This is a still a work in progress.

## Update as of 20240831

As of this date I am currently doing data cleaning and generating basic diagrams that provide insight into the dataset. I choose this dataset because of the socioeconmic insights it offers in food security. I am still doing work on this dataset.

This diagram goes into details showcasing the details whether an individual went hungry.
